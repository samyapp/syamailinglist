# Simply Yet Another Mailing List - WordPress Plugin #

A very simple mailing list signup form plugin for WordPress.

Visitors to your blog can sign up by entering there name, email address and country. Currently all of these are required.

The plugin stores these details together with the date added in its own database table.

There is currently no admin interface, and the only way to retrieve the data is accessing the database outside of WordPress.

The plugin _does not_ send out emails - it is solely for gathering them from visitors.
